## My process

### Built with
- Tailwind CSS
- Javascript localStorage
- HTML input type
- manifest.json

### Thoughts and troubles
- I had issues while wriring the conditionals(No, Alp & Symb) for the password to generate, i initially used array methods like slice() but it still didn't work the expected way, i ended up figuring out i could use concat() method.
- External link does not work on manifest.json for chrome extension which gave me headache as the dark mode feature is linked to font awesome external icon. I resolved this by using the svg instead of font awesome link.
- The link to my github at the footer wont work because of manifest, but i resolved it by adding target to my footer link.
- Tried out Javascript localStorage, i wanted to choose which to use between removeItem() and clear(), i couldn't get any article that focuses on differentiating them, i think i'll write an article on it
- To publish an extension on chrome, there is need to pay $5 membership fee so i decided to use Microsoft edge to publish for free instead. --- I've submitted the extension, and will need to check back in 7 working days. `Update` Extension has been approved and is now live on Microsoft addons
- `Update` Tried to implement if, for in, & for loop to replace the long if else statement for the password length conditionals and it worked 

### What I learned and used

#### Tailwind CSS Dark Mode
- In tailwind.config.js file, add **darkMode: "class"** at the base root such as 'content and theme', e.g
  ```js
  module.exports = {
	content: ["./**/*.{html,js}"],
	darkMode: "class",
	theme: {
		extend: {
			},
	},
	plugins: [],
   };
  ```

- Add whatever class-name you chose, for the dark mode toggle in your html file, e.g
  ```html
  <p class="toggle-dark" alt="toggle for light and dark mode">ðŸŒ“</p>
  ```

- Use this function in script.js file, querySelector value must be the same with class-name used in html file
  ```js
  /* SELF INVOKING FUNCTION FOR LIGHT & DARK MODE*/
  (function () {
	const darkToggle = document.querySelector(".toggle-dark");

	// eventListener
	darkToggle.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
		event.preventDefault();
		document.documentElement.classList.toggle("dark");
	});
	
    })();
  ```
- Then style HTML using **dark:**, e.g Header is given margin of 8px when in light-mode and 12px when in dark-mode
  ```html
  <h1 class="m-2 dark:m-3">
  ```

#### Chrome extension
- Create manifest.json file which is used to make extension, input the following
  ```json
  {
  "manifest_version": 3,
  "version": "1.0",
  "name": "",
  "description": "",
  "action": {
    "default_popup": "index.html",
    "default_icon": {
      "16": "",
      "32": "",
      "48":  "",
      "128": "",
    }
  },
  "permissions": [
    "activeTab"
  ]
  }
  ```
- To add external link, like a social link to your extension, add **target** to open the link on a new page.
  ```html
  <a target="_blank" href="">Lajoc_devs</a>
  ```

#### SVG Icon
- Download the desired font awesome icon as svg, open it, change the **svg fill** value to your desired color.
  ```
  <svg fill="#ECFDF5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><!--! Font Awesome Pro 6.4.2 by @fontawesome -  https://fontawesome.com License - https://fontawesome.com/license (Commercial License) Copyright 2023 Fonticons, Inc. --><path d="M448 256c0-106-86-192-192-192V448c106 0 192-86 192-192zM0 256a256 256 0 1 1 512 0A256 256 0 1 1 0 256z"/></svg>
  ```

#### GIT CLI
- To remove existing linkage of local workspace and a repository
  ```
  git remote rm origin
  ```
- To bring work from repositories to local workspace
  ```
  git pull
  ```
